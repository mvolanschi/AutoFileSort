# AutoFileSort

This script automatically categorizes files downloaded into a designated directory (downloads) into folders based on their types (videos, images, documents). It also detects if a file is university-related, such as those downloaded from platforms like 'Canvas', and sorts them into specific folders within the 'uni' directories.

It utilizes macOS metadata to identify the source website of each file and monitors changes in the download directory using the watchdog library."
